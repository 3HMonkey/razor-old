Another self-explanatory section used to take and manage your in-game screenshots.

## Imgur Integration

To help make it easier to share screenshot, you can `right-click` on any screenshot and upload it [Imgur](https://www.imgur.com).

* **Show Upload Notification**
    * Get a popup when the image has been uploaded. Clicking on that popup will open the link to the image.
* **Copy link to clipboard after upload**
    * Just as the name suggestions, after you upload an image to Imgur, place the URL on your clipboard for easy sharing.
*  **Open link in browser when shared**
    * Auto-open your browser to the image you just shared.
