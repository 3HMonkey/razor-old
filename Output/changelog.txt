Razor (v1.0.9.*) Changelog:

Razor is a FREE program.  Unlike competing programs like UOAssist, Razor does not charge any money at all and provides even more features.  Razor is now available on the regular OSI servers for unlimited accounts absolutely free.  But Razor needs your help!  Razor is now accepting donations over PayPal.  UOAssist (a similar program, but for OSI servers only) costs $15 PER ACCOUNT while Razor is FREE for UNLIMITED ACCOUNTS.  Your donation of $5 or $10 (or any amount!) is LESS than you would pay for a similar program!  Donations are greatly appreciated and will help ensure that the developers continue to improve and maintain this fine product.
Donate via PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/xclick/business=zippy%40runuo.com&item_name=Razor&no_shipping=1&no_note=1&tax=0&currency_code=USD

Additions:
-Support for protocol changes in client version 6.0.1.7.  This means that Razor will once again work on OSI (counters, drag/drop, etc).  Please Note: This WILL NOT allow client 6.0.1.7 to work with emulators which do not support that client version.  At this time, all emulators do not support this client version. (Big thanks to UOX (especially Xuri).)

Changes/Fixes:
-Changed the "Profile In Use" warning message to only warn you when a profile is overwritten.  Overall, this will cause the warning to show up a lot less.  This should also solve problems with profiles getting corrupted.
-Fixed some reported problems with the Heal/Cure self macros.
-Updated Chinese language pack (Thanks Cloud :-)
