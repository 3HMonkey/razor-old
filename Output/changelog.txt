Razor Beta 33 (v0.1.33.*)

Razor is a FREE program.  Unlike competing programs like UOAssist, Razor does not charge any money at all and provides even more features.  Razor is now available on the regular OSI servers for unlimited accounts absolutely free.  But Razor needs your help!  Razor is now accepting donations over PayPal.  UOAssist (a similar program, but for OSI servers only) costs $15 PER ACCOUNT while Razor is FREE for UNLIMITED ACCOUNTS.  Your donation of $5 or $10 (or any amount!) is LESS than you would pay for a similar program!  Donations are greatly appreciated and will help ensure that the developers continue to improve and maintain this fine product.

Additions:
-Comments (on their own line, using prefixed by # or //) will not be saved inside of macros and displayed on the macro tab.
-Added Exorcism to spell definitions.
-An internal Razor target will now save the previous target the client had and resend it after a choice is made. (Example: You have a spell target up, you press your "Set Last Target" hotkey. You target a person (thus setting them as your last target).  Instead of canceling the spell target, Razor will now resend that spell Target to the client.)

Changes/Fixes:
-Several other small crashes have been fixed.
-Fixed problems with images not displaying correctly in titlebar
-Fixed a problem with UOAM not properly logging houses
-Fixed serious network communications bug.  All users are strongly recommended to upgrade.
-Fixed some small and unlikely RPV playback bugs.
