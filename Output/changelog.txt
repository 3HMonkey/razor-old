Razor (v1.0.5.*) Changelog:

Razor is a FREE program.  Unlike competing programs like UOAssist, Razor does not charge any money at all and provides even more features.  Razor is now available on the regular OSI servers for unlimited accounts absolutely free.  But Razor needs your help!  Razor is now accepting donations over PayPal.  UOAssist (a similar program, but for OSI servers only) costs $15 PER ACCOUNT while Razor is FREE for UNLIMITED ACCOUNTS.  Your donation of $5 or $10 (or any amount!) is LESS than you would pay for a similar program!  Donations are greatly appreciated and will help ensure that the developers continue to improve and maintain this fine product.
Donate via PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/xclick/business=zippy%40runuo.com&item_name=Razor&no_shipping=1&no_note=1&tax=0&currency_code=USD

Additions:
-The "Veteran Rewards" gump can now be filtered out by the "Rewards Gump" filter in the filters list on the general tab.
-There are now 5 Restock agents.
-Hot Bags for all of the agents will now display the agent they are associated with when you single click them in game.
-Razor no longer modifies your Login.cfg file when you use the Welcome Screen. Along with this, Razor now has a "--server address,port" command line option.  Passing this option to Razor will cause the welcome screen not to show.

Changes/Fixes:
-Profile overwriting problems have been fixed.
-The values entered for Game Window size are now (somewhat) bounds checked.
-Removed some redundant logic from the Network code of Razor.  This may greatly improve Razor's speed on some systems.
