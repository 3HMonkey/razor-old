Razor (v1.0.8.*) Changelog:

Razor is a FREE program.  Unlike competing programs like UOAssist, Razor does not charge any money at all and provides even more features.  Razor is now available on the regular OSI servers for unlimited accounts absolutely free.  But Razor needs your help!  Razor is now accepting donations over PayPal.  UOAssist (a similar program, but for OSI servers only) costs $15 PER ACCOUNT while Razor is FREE for UNLIMITED ACCOUNTS.  Your donation of $5 or $10 (or any amount!) is LESS than you would pay for a similar program!  Donations are greatly appreciated and will help ensure that the developers continue to improve and maintain this fine product.
Donate via PayPal: https://www.paypal.com/xclick/business=zippy%40runuo.com&item_name=Razor&no_shipping=1&no_note=1&tax=0&currency_code=USD

Additions:
-Overhead Health messages! This options allows Razor to shows People and Creature's health (as a percentage) over their head whenever their health changes.  The numbers are also shown in color (from blue-green at 100% to yellow at 50% purple-red at 0%).  The format of these numbers can also be changed (default is "[NN%]").
-Overhead Status messages (mana / stamina) for party members.  Works the same as overhead health.  You can change the format of the message by editing the "PartyStatFmt" value in your profile.xml file.  (Sorry, there was not room for another textbox on the More Options tab)
-Staff Only Item filter - (On the General tab, in the Filters list.) When enabled, this filter will hide all hidden items as well as Blockers and LOS Blockers.

Changes/Fixes:
-Misc Packet Handler crash fixes.
-Fix for RandomTargets targeting dead people.
-Shuffled around some options and tabs to make room for the new overhead messages.
-Fixed battle axe special moves
